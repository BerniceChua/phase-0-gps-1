##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I think that I have a solid understanding of the basic commands that we have been using, but I find myself in the position of "not knowing what I don't know"; the unknown unknowns as it were.  Earlier in the week I was a bit confused about how to switch between different remote repos easily.  But that arose from a simple misconception of how we access our online repos.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I now understand the `git pull` is basically a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`, although I am still working out in my mind why it would be beneficial in certain cases to do it step by step.  It is also more clear to my why we should always create a feature branch before beginning any work: if you don't and you push your master to Github you have no chance to review and merge the data; the push will instead act immediately, directly updating the master branch online.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

As I mentioned above, I asked about the use of Fetch and Merge.  We also talked a bit about using tab to autocomplete commands.

##What still confuses you about git?

Although we made it through the Release 5: Merge Conflict portion of the challenge, there are still some questions I have concerning this process and how to resolve merge conflicts.  It took us quite a while before we understood that we would see the merge conflict information in our sublime file and not in the compare section of Github.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Well, it is new to me, so I am not sure what I was supposed to expect.  Overall it went well, although I feel like we dove a little too deeply into some rabbit holes.  In the future, I will be sure to suggest that we timebox ourselves and check-in on our over all progress in the challenge as we progress to ensure that we stay on target with regard to time.
