GPS 1.1 Challenge

1. Write the different terminal commands that have been used to this point in the challenge:
   - `git clone [URL of repo here]` = copies a remote repository to the local machine.
   - `pwd` = "print working directory", this lets you know which directory or folder you are viewing.
   - `mkdir` = "make directory"; this creates a new directory or folder.
   - `ls -la` = "list"; this shows the files that live in the current directory; and the `-l` flag means "long view", which shows all the details; the `-a` flag means "all", which shows all the files.
