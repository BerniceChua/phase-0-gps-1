Each of you should add a reflection file to the same repo. Be sure to start on a feature branch! Create a new file named Lastname-reflection.md. Answer the following questions in that file using Markdown. Go through the git workflow to add, commit, make a pull request, and merge it to the master repo.

Answer these questions in your reflection:

    What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    What still confuses you about git?
    How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
